# Welcome

*Scope:*  
Installing Pi-Hole on my network and evaluate the outcome.  

*What:*  
Pi-Hole is an primarily anapplication that blocks adverts (ads), trackers, and in-game ads; It is meant to operate at a network-level.  

*How:*  
Installing application on a headless Ubuntu Server; By configuring the firewall to forward all DNS request to the Pi-Hole.  

Before we get started, let's review the requierements.
  
## Requirements:
1. Virtual Machine
   1. Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS
   2. 1 Core CPU
   3. 1GB RAM
   4. 16GB HDD
   5. Static IP
   6. Network connectivity
2. Ability to forward DNS request from firewall/home router.
   
**Note:** for the sake of this article, I will not cover the creation of the VM. I will be starting with a fresh instance of Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS with the latest patch/update intalled.

## Installation of Pi-Hole:
1. Connect to the server via preffered SSH client (I like MobaXterm, because ... (insert image) )
2. Lets find out if we have `git` installed on the server:
    > `popeye@pi-hole:~$ apt list --installed | grep git`  
    > ...And it look like it does  
    > `WARNING: apt does not have a stable CLI interface. Use with caution in scripts.`  
    > `findutils/xenial,now 4.6.0+git+20160126-2 amd64 [installed]`  
    > `git/xenial-updates,xenial-security,now 1:2.7.4-0ubuntu1.6 amd64 [installed]`  
    > `git-man/xenial-updates,xenial-updates,xenial-security,xenial-security,now 1:2.7.4-0ubuntu1.6 all [installed]`  

3. I like my applications in the `/opt/` directory, let's create the directory:
    > `popeye@pi-hole:~$ sudo mkdir /opt/pi-hole`
    > `[sudo] password for popeye:`
    
4. Lets clone Pi-Hole repositiory on the server:
    > `popeye@pi-hole:~$ sudo git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole.git /opt/pi-hole`  
    > `popeye@pi-hole:~$ cd "/opt/pi-hole/automated install/"`  
    > `popeye@pi-hole:~$ sudo bash basic-install.sh`  
    
Once you execute the script, the application will launch a new window. From there do the following:  
5. Configuration of Pi-hole:
   1. Accept the fact that "`This intaller will transform your device into a network-wide ad blocker!`"
   2. Free and open source - Here is the [URL](http://pi-hole.net/donate) if you wish to donate.
   3. Reminder that..

   4. Choose your preffered upstream DNS Server. In my case I go with Cloudfare, at the time [this article](https://medium.com/@nykolas.z/dns-resolvers-performance-compared-cloudflare-x-google-x-quad9-x-opendns-149e803734e5) was written they prove to have the fastest response time for North American region. My second option would be Quad9.

   5. Choose the list of third party ad-blocker you wish to use:  
    ![3rdPartyList](/img//pihole/pihole_5.PNG)
   6. Select the protocol you wish to use: # Add IPv6 if you have running a dual-stack.  
     `[*] IPv4 Block ads over IPv4`  
     `[*] IPv6 Block ads over IPv6`  
   7. Review your settings:

   8. Install the WebAdmin panel:  
   `Do you wish to install the web admin interface?`  
   `(*) On (Recommended)`  
   `( ) Off`  
   9. Install the `lighttpd` web server: # If you dont install `lighttpd` you wont have access to your WebUI. You need both the wev server and WebAdmin panel.  
   `Do you wish to install the web server (lighttpd)?`  
   `(*) On (Recommended)`  
   `( ) Off`
   
... And that's it. In theory, you have converted your server into network-wide ad blocker, thanks to Pi-Hole. Now lets go over the configuration of my FortiGate.
Now, this will vary for everyone. Ultimately you want to forward all of your DNS request that goes throught said firewall/router to your Pi-Hole, which will reach out to Upstream DNS providers (step 5.4)

## Configuration of FortiGate:

As a preface, this is my current config on my Windows PC:
        > `Ethernet adapter Ethernet:`  
        > `Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 10.30.10.1`  
        > `DNS Servers . . . . . . . . . . . : 10.30.10.1`

Let's review the config on the firewall:
