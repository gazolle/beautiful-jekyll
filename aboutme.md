title: About me

---

Adventurous; curious and yet cautious, I grasp every moment and live life at the fullest.

I look forward to fullfill my journey in cyber security, currently working as a SOC analyst for a Canadian teleco.

### Quick History
Funny enough, I used to be work in the HVAC field as a certified technician. After about 2 years, I started to loose interest (mainly because of harsh and cold canadian winter, cracked skin..) I turned around and went to college to become a 'Computer Technician'. After graduation I found a job as a Security Analyst in a teleco. Shuffled around internally, moved to other company -- just to came back where I originally was. Life is good.

Some lessons I've learnt in my young career so far:  
- More money != hapinness.  
- It's not greener and the other side of the fence.
